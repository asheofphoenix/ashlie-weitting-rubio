				<div>

					<p>I've had a lot of experience working as a group for assigned projects. It's hard work and takes a lot of coordination on everyone's part. I've learned how to listen to others more effectively and when to speak up. I feel confident and comfortable to share my ideas as well even if I think they might be silly. If there's one thing I've learned about this career field, it's silly ideas are often the best ideas to expand on.</p>

					<p>I'm comfortable in a leadership role or supportive roles in a group. Everyone's role and tasks are vital to accomplising our shared goal. I'm comfortable working with any person as long as they are respectful.</p>

				<summary>HTML and CSS</summary>

				<div>
					
					<p>I am comfortable working with HTML and CSS to build web pages responsively from the ground up. I find it a lot of fun to expand my knowledge in this area and tinker with code.</p>

					<p>I currently have no knowledge in Javascript. I'm always looking for new challenges and it's on my list of things to learn.</p>

				<summary>Communication</summary>

				<div>
					
					<p>I am a big communicator in a team setting. This has to do with playing sports and working in restaurant where communication had to be instant or something could go wrong in a second. I'm used to communicating my needs and talking out ideas to ensure everyone is on the same page. I love working with people and I am easy to get along with.</p>

				<summary>Punctuality</summary>

				<div>
					
					<p>When I was in high school I had two great instructors who drilled home the phrase, "If you're not 15 minutes early, you're 15 minutes late". I now adhere to this in every aspect of my life. I show up early to meetings, to work, to appointments, everything.</p>

				</div>

				<summary>Customer Service</summary>

				<div>
					
					<p>I've worked in restaurant for 10 years and I've found I have a burning desire to help people in absolutely any way I can. I also discovered I have infinite amount of patience. I like to do what I can to help people get what they need and am always very interested in how people think.</p>

			<details>
				
				<summary>Problem Solving</summary>

				<div>
					
					<p>I love a challenge. I enjoy a lot of different types of puzzles. I enjoy working through the problem to unravel the solution or solutions. I have thoroughly enjoyed working through things and trying to find creative solutions. I use it in my home when it comes to tackling a project.</p>
