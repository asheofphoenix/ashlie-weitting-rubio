		<h1>Building a Design Website</h1>

		<p>In Responsive Design 2, we learned how to build components with just HTML and CSS by building a design website. I had no idea what a design website was when I started the project. It was hard to wrap my mind around it at first, I had to keep it in mind that the design website is a blueprint for the actual website. By building it as we went, I learned there's a lot of amazing things you can do with HTML and CSS that I was never aware of.</p>

				<h2>How I started</h2>

				<img src="images/mood-board.jpg" alt="technology/futuristic background photo with a group of color swatches next to it">

				<p>The first place I started was trying to decide on a color palette. This was a lot harder than I thought and I changed color groups at least three times. I noticed a lot of tech websites used darker colors and I really wanted mine to stand out while not deviating too far from view people expect from AR/VR websites. I started with a purple base, but I was afraid it might not appeal to all demographics. These color swatches were based off the image and ultimately the inspiration for the rest of the design.</p>

				<h2>Accordion</h2>

				<img src="images/accordion.jpg" alt="screen shot of an accordion component">

				<p>I thought for sure that learning accordions were going to be super difficult and I was intimidated to learn them. But they ended up being fairly simple and honestly my favorite feature to build. I like how customizable they are especially when it comes to the changing the default drop down arrows.</p>

				<h2>Modal</h2>

				<img src="images/modal.jpg" alt="screen shot of modal">

				<p>Learning how to design modals was interesting to me. I'm not very fluent in javascript at all and luckily that wasn't a requirement for this class. However the modal requires a tiny bit of it in order to work. It was something that was given to us as part of the assignment thankfully. I really enjoyed coding animation into the pop up since animation is a throwback for me. This inspired me to try to learn javascript in my spare time. I'm not very good yet, but it's very interesting.</p>

				<h2>Grid</h2>

				<img src="images/card-grid.jpg" alt="screen shot of the grid layout on the site">

				<p>With all the new skills I learned in coding components, we learned some neat things about layouts using HTML and CSS as well. I thought flex was fun and easy to work with, but grid is so flexable! It's kind of like using clay to mold webl layouts. Here's a sample of my grid layout for articles.</p>
