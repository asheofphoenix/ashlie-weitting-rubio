		<h1>Google Advance Image Filter Re-design</h1>

		<p>In my design research class, I was asked to redesign Google’s advanced image filter based on real user interviews and compiling the data. I will take you step by step through my process.</p>

		<section class="indepth-project-container">

			<div class="indepth-project-card">

				<h2>The Problem</h2>
					
				<img src="images/currentdesign3.jpg" alt="screen shot of google advanced image filter">

				<p>We start at the problem. Google’s current advanced image filter is practically invisible unless you either know where to look or you happen to stumble into it. I personally, happened to stumble into it when first taking on this assignment. </p>

				<p>The filter is hidden under the search bar in the images tab. Not just hidden under the search bar, but you must dig for it in a sub menu! One of my interviewees was a teacher who makes a lot of slides for their class and uses the image search a lot. However, they had absolutely no idea this feature even existed!</p>
					
				<p>This is the problem</p>

			</div>

			<div class="indepth-project-card">
				
				<h2>Screener</h2>

					<img src="images/google-screener.jpg" alt="screen shot of screener document">

					<p>Once I identified the problem, I outlined how I wanted to proceed. I started with a screener that would help me determine if my interviewers were qualified enough to help me with my research. This document allowed me to make sure I wasn’t wasting both our time. Once my candidates pasted this screener, I set up times to preform a remote meeting via User ZoomGo.</p>

				<h2>Usability Testing</h2>

					<img src="images/google-script.jpg" alt="screen shot of script document">

					<p>During the meeting with interviewees, I followed this script. You're welcome to review it. This was usability test to test my theory that Google’s advanced image filter failed its user base. User ZoomGo was a great tool to use during the pandemic! I would record and take notes and interview remotely. It also allowed me the luxury of being able to go back and review and add more notes where I missed them before. </p>

			</div></a>

			<div class="indepth-project-card">

				<h2>Synthasizing and Gaining Insight</h2>
					
					<img src="images/google-insights.jpg" alt="screen shot of sheets file">

					<p>I took the data from each interview and plugged in the things that I felt were the most important during the interview. I color coded the results based on each participant. It was clear from my findings that the image filter was failing the user base. </p>

				<h2>Presentation</h2>
				
				<img src="images/google-presentation.jpg" alt="screen shot of google presentation">

				<p>I had to present my finding to “get approval” to go forward with a prototype of the filter redesign. This was so much fun because I felt so confident what I was presenting that I probably ended up taking more about my users than I should have. My audience was even impressed with my findings and research. Please review the presentation at your own discretion.</p>

				<h2>Prototype</h2>
				
					<img src="images/google-result.jpg" alt="screen shoot of figma prototype">


					<p>I got the approval to build my prototype. I used Figma because I find it so much easier to use than Sketch or Adobe XD. This took me ages even though I cheated and used screenshots. I over thought the whole thing at one point and had to scale myself back. I’m incredibly proud of the work I did on this. Each section is clickable. Please feel free to test the prototype.</p>
