		<p>I'm a novice UXUI'er. I'm slowly building my portfolio and learning a ton of new things about software, code, design thinking, user research and how to combine these skills. I have a passion for creative thinking and figuring out how people think and view the world. I want to make people's lives as easy as possible by taking down some of the cognitive load while they interact with products.</p>

		<p>On a personal level, I have an extensive art background moving from Graphic Design, Illustration to Animation. I've sketched my whole life and continue to do so. I had to give up on college for a long time while I survived my way through life. I was a Shift Leader for 6 years. And worked in the hospital as Housekeeping staff and then Sterile Processing. When I moved to Texas with my best friend, who is my now husband, I made the decision to complete my life's goal which was to go back to school and graduate with a degree. It took me a little while to fall into UXUI, and I have not looked back.</p>

		<p>Now I've learned a ton and am still learning everyday about how to improve and hone my skills in this area. It's a rollercoaster somedays when I'm thinking, 'I'm not good enough' to really feeling the creative energy. We all live with doubt, I think it's more important how we push through it that really matters. I know this is what I'm meant to do with my career, so I will break that wall every day because I enjoy what I do to the max.</p>
