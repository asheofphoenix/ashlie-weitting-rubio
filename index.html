		<p>I graduated with an Associates in Applied Science in UXUI from Austin Community College. I'm excited to build my career in UX Design and exercise the skills I've learned. I'm ready to be apart of a team and help the company better support its users. I have a passion for creative thinking and figuring out how people think and view the world. I want to make people's lives as easy as possible by taking down some of the cognitive load while they interact with products.</p>

		<p>I have an extensive art background moving from Graphic Design, Illustration, to Animation and landing into UXUI. I've sketched my whole life and continue to do so every day. I had to give up on college for a long time while I survived my way through life. I was a Shift Leader for 6 years. And worked in the hospital as housekeeping staff and then Sterile Processing. When I moved to Texas with my best friend, who is my now husband, I made the decision to complete my life's goal which was to go back to school and graduate with a degree. I'm so proud of myself for completing one of my life long goals!</p>

		<p>I'm currently giving back to the program that helped build and shape me at ACC and working to mentor and tutor students as they need it. I love working with students and applying the things I've learned to help them learn and grow. While I love this work, I'm ready to tackle bigger projects and extend my knowledge. I can't wait to be a part of your team and help you tackle some tricky projects!</p>
